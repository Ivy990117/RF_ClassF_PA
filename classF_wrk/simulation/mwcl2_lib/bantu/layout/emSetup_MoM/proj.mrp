Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

The port setup needed to be corrected:
Calibration will not be used for port "P9" (pin
"P9" is not on the edge between a conductive and
a nonconductive region).
